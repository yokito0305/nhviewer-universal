## Tech Stack

- Flutter
- Provider
- Go Router
- Drift + sqlite3
- Dio
- cached_network_image / flutter_cache_manager
- flutter_image_compress
- Freezed / json_serializable / build_runner

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">‣ back to top</a></p>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter `3.41.5` recommended to match CI
- Dart SDK compatible with `>=3.10.3 <4.0.0`
- Android Studio or Xcode if you want to build mobile targets locally
- A Flutter editor setup such as [VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor)

`pubspec.yaml` currently allows Flutter `>=3.38.4`, but using the same version as CI is the safest choice when generating code and running tests.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ttdyce/nhviewer-universal.git
   cd nhviewer-universal
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Generate source files used by Drift / Freezed / JSON serialization
   ```sh
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```
4. Run static analysis
   ```sh
   flutter analyze
   ```
5. Run tests
   ```sh
   flutter test
   ```
6. Start the app
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

### When To Re-run Code Generation

Run the `build_runner` command again after changing:

- Drift tables or database models
- `@freezed` models
- `@JsonSerializable` / JSON-mapped models

If generated files drift out of sync, build or analysis errors are expected until regeneration is complete.

## Local Build Commands

### Debug APK

```sh
flutter build apk --debug
```

### Release APK

```sh
flutter build apk --release
```

### iOS build without code signing

```sh
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

This is useful for local verification only. It does not produce a TestFlight-ready artifact by itself.

## Project Build Flow

The repository currently uses code generation as part of the standard build pipeline:

1. `flutter pub get`
2. `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
3. `flutter analyze`
4. `flutter test`
5. platform build command such as `flutter build apk --release`

This is the same order used by the GitHub Actions workflows.

## GitHub Actions

### Android APK workflow

Workflow file: [.github/workflows/flutter-workflow-apk.yml](./.github/workflows/flutter-workflow-apk.yml)

Current CI steps:

1. Checkout
2. Set up Flutter `3.41.5`
3. `flutter pub get`
4. `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
5. `flutter analyze`
6. `flutter test`
7. `flutter build apk --release`

### GitHub-hosted unsigned iOS build

Workflow file: [.github/workflows/flutter-workflow-ipa.yml](./.github/workflows/flutter-workflow-ipa.yml)

If you cannot build iOS locally, you can produce an unsigned IPA from GitHub Actions:

1. Open the `flutter-workflow-ipa` workflow in the Actions tab
2. Trigger it with `workflow_dispatch`
3. Download the `nhviewer-ios-unsigned` artifact after the macOS job finishes

The generated IPA is unsigned. It is useful for remote build verification, but it is not ready for TestFlight or App Store submission.

## Project Notes

- Local persistence is now Drift-based rather than sqflite-managed application code
- Downloaded files are stored separately from image cache so cache clearing does not remove downloads
- The current downloads implementation focuses on job management UI and offline asset persistence
- Offline reader switching and richer downloaded-library browsing are still later-phase work
